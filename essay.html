              <p class="flow-text"> Hidden in the industrial park of Staten Island lies a hidden gem not many New Yorkers know about. Built in 1831, Sailors Snug Harbor originally served as a home for retired and disabled sailors. Spanning 83 acres, Snug Harbor holds a collection of significant 19th-century buildings. 26 Greek Revival, Beaux-Arts Italianate, and Victorian buildings decorate the park, each standing tall against the backdrop of nature's green plants and trees.</p>
              <p class="flow-text"> Today Snug Harbor sits as New York's prominent cultural center. Run by the Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden and affiliated with Smithsonian, the group provides educational and recreational opportunities for people all over the city.</p>
              <p class="flow-text"> Snug Harbor pales in comparison to Times Square, the "heart of New York City," but its charm and serenity hold a special place in my heart. The busy streets filled with people are swapped for gravel paths lined with bushes and park benches. The noisy cars and buses swapped for the rustling of leaves and chirping from bugs and birds alike. Snug Harbor's history is like none other; its history is tangible and visible, standing tall right in front of everyone who passes. There is no debate about its history; it is all there to see. Its statues and buildings do not lie. They have been here all this time, waiting for the right moment to reach out to those who go by and invite them into a world full of fascination and discovery. A distraction from daily life, a change of pace.</p>
              <p class="flow-text"> Snug Harbor holds memories of childhood wonder and joy and more recent memories of exploration and enchantment. It is somewhere that I never felt like I grew out of. From first moving to Staten Island and playing in the Children's Museum, spending my afternoons in the play areas pretending I was truly in the Amazon rainforest, or part of a construction team, building a house. I was then going to the music and arts programs to learn piano, jump-starting my love for music, and 12 years later, going to the events in the Cultural Center. Snug has allowed me to connect and genuinely love my culture and who I am. My culture—spending winter nights in the park with friends and family, enjoying the lights and festivities of all the different celebrations, seeing an empty field transformed into a maze of lights and decorations for all to see and enjoy—the warm glow of the lights against the chill of winter winds. The Winter Lantern Festival is the newest addition to my Snug Harbor experience. I went with my grandparents and friends, wandering between tall glowing flowers, dragons, zodiac animals, and mushrooms. A celebration of Chinese tradition, but with a modern twist.</p>
              <p class="flow-text"> Snug Harbor has provided a place for me to explore my creative interests. A place to celebrate holidays. A place to spend a nice summer day. A place for me to discover the love for me and my people.</p>
              <p class="flow-text"> Snug Harbor stands as one of the fundamental building blocks of the person I am today. And it may be for many others as well. It sits waiting for someone to visit it and enjoy what it has to offer—a treasure chest hidden among the rocks that is New York City. Snug has, and will, always provide a space for development and growth to all those who seek it.</p>
